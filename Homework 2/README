Since I did most of my homework in Jupyter and then made sure there were no run-time errors on Ugradx, I thought it'd be easier if I just included the output of my Jupyter notebooks for the questions (specifically those that required graphical output) as a PDF. Answers to some of the questions that can't be found in the code itself for exercises 2-4 can be found in the problem set 2 document, and specifically number 1 can be found in the hw2 pdf (since I LaTeX'd it). Oh, the answer to the kmer counts was included in the documents called test_kmer_counts and train_kmer_counts, though I had some trouble with formatting (sorry)
